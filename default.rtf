B&M risk is fair to good.

The need for formal, document, ECPs still applies, and a spare ring gear for the ball mill. Otherwise, the mechanical integrity program is strong. The site is developing a three year NDE program for the hoists, in addition to their extensive inspections, which will further improve their reliability.

Some relatively minor improvements in the electrical integrity program is needed. Documenting/formalizing the IR scanning program, with reports for trending is important; they are performing the IR scans, but no field service report is provided. The PD survey is due to an internal standards change. The battery capacitance testing is a need to identify the health and state of the battery between five year capacity (performance/discharge) tests; however, if they meet the conditions outlined in the recommendation, capacity testing would no longer be required.

Site management has created a strong culture in resiliency, and high level of knowledge. They are, and continue to be, great partners in resilience.
