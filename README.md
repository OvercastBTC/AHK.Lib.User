This repo contains the libraries I use

Most of them are not mine, and will be libraries of other people.

Why reinvent the wheel right?

## People to check out for cool libraries:

* [**@GroggyOtter**(https://github.com/GroggyOtter)
* [**@Axlefublr**](https://github.com/Axlefublr)
* [**@thqby**](https://github.com/thqby)
* [**@Descolada**](https://github.com/Descolada)

## Dependencies

The libraries will generally list all of their dependencies at the top by

```
#Include <this-library>
```

All the libraries I use will be in this repository, so you can *technically* use any / all of my / not my libraries
